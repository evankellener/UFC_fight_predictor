# Enhanced UFC Fight Predictor

## üöÄ New Features Overview

This enhanced version of the UFC Fight Predictor addresses all the requirements you specified:

### 1. üé≠ Fighter Version Selection
- **What it does**: Allows you to specify which "version" of a fighter to use for predictions
- **How it works**: Each fighter has multiple "versions" representing their post-fight stats from different fights
- **Example**: If you pick Petr Yan, you can choose to use his stats from his last fight, his fight before that, or any other fight in his career
- **API**: Use `/predict_with_versions` endpoint with `fighter1_version` and `fighter2_version` parameters

### 2. üîÑ Proper Postcomp Stats Usage
- **What it does**: Ensures that the prefight stats for a fighter's next fight match the postcomp stats from their previous fight
- **How it works**: When predicting a fight, it uses the `postcomp_elo` (and other stats) from each fighter's most recent fight as the `precomp_elo` for the prediction
- **Example**: Israel Adesanya had a `postcomp_elo` of 1675 after his last fight, so for his next fight prediction, that 1675 is used as the `precomp_elo`
- **Implementation**: The system automatically tracks and uses the correct postcomp stats for each fighter

### 3. üìä Bidirectional Prediction Averaging
- ** What it does**: Makes two predictions and averages them for the final result
- **How it works**: 
  - Prediction 1: Fighter A vs Fighter B (using Fighter A's stats first)
  - Prediction 2: Fighter B vs Fighter A (using Fighter B's stats first)
  - Final result: Average of both predictions
- **Benefits**: More robust predictions that account for the order of fighter presentation
- **Output**: Shows both individual predictions and the averaged result

### 4. üéØ Consistent Normalizers
- **What it does**: Ensures the same scaling and imputation is used for both training and testing
- **How it works**: 
  - Uses `RobustScaler` for consistent feature scaling
  - Uses `SimpleImputer` with median strategy for missing values
  - Same scaler and imputer are applied to both training data and prediction inputs
- **Benefits**: Prevents data leakage and ensures predictions are made with the same preprocessing as training

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### EnhancedUFCPredictor Class
The main class that handles all enhanced functionality:

```python
from enhanced_predictor import EnhancedUFCPredictor

# Initialize with your data
predictor = EnhancedUFCPredictor('path/to/your/data.csv')

# Make basic prediction (uses most recent versions)
result = predictor.predict_fight("Fighter A", "Fighter B")

# Make prediction with specific versions
result = predictor.predict_fight_with_versions(
    "Fighter A", "Fighter B", 
    fighter1_version=2,  # Use version 2 for Fighter A
    fighter2_version=1   # Use version 1 for Fighter B
)
```

### Key Methods

#### `get_fighter_versions(fighter_name)`
Returns all available versions (post-fight stats) for a fighter:
```python
versions = predictor.get_fighter_versions("Israel Adesanya")
for i, version in enumerate(versions):
    print(f"Version {i}: {version['fight_date']} - ELO: {version['postcomp_elo']}")
```

#### `predict_fight_with_versions(fighter1, fighter2, fighter1_version, fighter2_version)`
Makes a prediction using specific fighter versions:
```python
result = predictor.predict_fight_with_versions(
    "Israel Adesanya", "Sean Strickland",
    fighter1_version=0,  # Use first version (earliest fight)
    fighter2_version=None  # Use most recent version
)
```

## üåê Web API Endpoints

### New Endpoints

#### `POST /predict_with_versions`
Make predictions with specific fighter versions:
```json
{
    "fighter1": "Israel Adesanya",
    "fighter2": "Sean Strickland",
    "fighter1_version": 2,
    "fighter2_version": 1
}
```

#### `GET /fighter/{fighter_name}/versions`
Get available versions for a specific fighter:
```json
{
    "fighter_name": "Israel Adesanya",
    "versions": [
        {
            "version_id": 0,
            "fight_date": "2024-09-09",
            "opponent": "Sean Strickland",
            "result": "Loss",
            "postcomp_elo": 1675.0,
            "postcomp_strike_elo": 1650.0,
            "age": 35,
            "weight": 185,
            "reach": 80,
            "height": 76
        }
    ],
    "total_versions": 1
}
```

### Enhanced Response Format
The prediction response now includes:
- Fighter version information
- Bidirectional prediction details

```bash
cd src
python test_enhanced_predictor.py
```

This will test:
- Fighter version functionality
- Basic predictions

# Use Adesanya's stats from his 3rd most recent fight
# Use Strickland's stats from his most recent fight
result = predictor.predict_fight_with_versions(
    "Israel Adesanya", "Sean Strickland",
    fighter1_version=2,  # 3rd most recent (0-indexed)
    fighter2_version=None  # Most recent
)
```

### Get Fighter Versions
