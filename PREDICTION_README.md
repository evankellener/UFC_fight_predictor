- **Physical Stats**: Age, height, weight, reach ratios
- **Fight History**: Recent performance (3, 5, and career stats)
- **Accuracy Metrics**: Striking, takedown, submission accuracy

### **Machine Learning**
- **Model**: Logistic Regression with regularization
- **Features**: 30+ engineered features
- **Training**: Time-series cross-validation
- **Performance**: Typically 60-70% accuracy on test data

## üìä Model Performance

- **Training Data**: ~10,000+ fights (2009-2022)
- **Test Data**: ~1,000+ fights (2023-2024)
- **Features Used**: 30+ engineered features
- **Accuracy**: Varies by weight class and era
- **Confidence**: High confidence predictions (>70%) tend to be more accurate

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### **Web Interface**
1. Open `http://localhost:5000`
2. Enter two fighter names
3. Click "Predict Winner"
4. View detailed results with confidence and key factors

### **Command Line**
```bash
# Basic prediction
python cli_predictor.py "Jon Jones" "Ciryl Gane"

# Get fighter info
python cli_predictor.py --info "Khabib Nurmagomedov"

# Verbose output
python cli_predictor.py -v "Israel Adesanya" "Sean Strickland"
```

### **Python API**
```python
from simple_predictor import SimpleUFCPredictor

predictor = SimpleUFCPredictor()
result = predictor.predict_fight("Fighter 1", "Fighter 2")

print(f"Winner: {result['predicted_winner']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']:.1%}")
print(f"Odds: {result['american_odds']}")
```

## üèÜ What Makes This Special

### **Advanced ELO System**
- **Base ELO**: Traditional ELO with UFC-specific adjustments
- **Striking ELO**: Specialized rating for striking exchanges
- **Time Decay**: Intelligent rating decay based on inactivity
- **Weight Class**: Adjustments for different divisions

### **Comprehensive Features**
- **Physical Metrics**: Age ratios, height/weight indices, reach advantages
- **Performance History**: Recent fight performance, accuracy trends
- **Opponent Context**: How fighters perform against similar opponents
- **Temporal Patterns**: Performance changes over time

### **Professional Output**
- **Confidence Levels**: Clear confidence scoring for each prediction
- **Betting Odds**: Professional American odds format
- **Key Factors**: Explainable AI showing what influenced the prediction
- **Fighter Comparison**: Side-by-side stats and ratings

## üö® Important Notes

### **Data Requirements**
