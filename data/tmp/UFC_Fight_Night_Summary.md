# UFC Fight Night Prediction Summary

## Results Overview
The model successfully predicted outcomes for 15 out of 22 matchups, with the remaining 7 matchups returning errors due to fighter data not being found in the dataset.

## Confidence Levels
The model's predictions show very high confidence levels, with an average confidence of 97.77% for successful predictions. The most confident prediction was for Chepe Mariscal over Ricardo Ramos at 99.88%.

## Data Availability Issues
Several fighters were not found in the database, causing prediction failures:
- Julius Walker
- Ion Cuțelaba
- Nick Klein
- Ricky Simón
- Austin Vanderford
- Eric McConico
- Raffael Cerqueira
- Mário Pinto

This suggests these may be newer fighters with limited UFC fight history, or they might have name variants in the database.

## Observations

1. **High Confidence Pattern**: The model tends to predict outcomes with extremely high confidence levels, mostly above 95%. This could indicate either a very accurate model or possibly an overconfident model.

2. **Fighter Recognition**: The model works well with established fighters but fails with new or less known fighters.

3. **Next Steps**: To improve predictions for all matchups, the database should be updated with recent fighter data, especially for newer UFC prospects.

4. **Verification**: These predictions should be compared against actual fight outcomes once they occur to assess the model's real-world accuracy.
